# Projucate

We believe that there is a fundamental gap between the way that information is taught vs. the way that it is learned. This project hopes to bridge that gap by creating a community of self-motivated developers in your area focused around project-based learning. There is no failing, there is no grading -- all you have is what you can do with what you know. What would you do if you knew you couldn't fail? Stay hungry, stay foolish.
